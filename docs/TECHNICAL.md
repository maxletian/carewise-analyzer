# CareWise - Technical Documentation

This document provides technical details of the CareWise application architecture, component structure, and implementation details for developers working on the project.

## Architecture Overview

CareWise follows a component-based architecture using React's functional components and hooks. The application uses several React contexts to manage global state:

- `AuthContext` - Handles user authentication, session management, and role-based access control
- `HealthContext` - Manages health data collection, processing, and analysis
- `ThemeContext` - Controls application theme (dark/light mode)

## Key Components

### Layout Components

- `Layout.tsx` - Wrapper component that handles the overall application layout
- `Navbar.tsx` - Top navigation bar with user controls and theme toggle
- `Sidebar.tsx` - Primary navigation for desktop users, collapsible and responsive
- `Footer.tsx` - Application footer with links and copyright information

### Authentication Flow

Authentication is handled through the `AuthContext` provider which offers:

- User registration and login
- Session persistence
- Role-based authorization
- Activity logging
- Concurrent user management (20 users max)

### Form Components

Health assessment forms use React Hook Form with Zod for validation, providing:

- Form state management
- Field validation
- Error handling
- Form submission

### Data Visualization

The application uses Recharts for data visualization in the Analysis page:

- Line charts for trends over time
- Bar charts for comparative analysis
- Radar charts for comprehensive health profiles

## State Management

### AuthContext

The authentication context provides:

```typescript
interface AuthContextType {
  user: User | null;
  login: (email: string, password: string) => Promise<void>;
  logout: () => void;
  signup: (email: string, password: string, isAdminSignup: boolean) => Promise<void>;
  isAdmin: () => boolean;
  logActivity: (action: string) => void;
}
```

### HealthContext

The health context manages:

```typescript
interface HealthContextType {
  healthData: HealthData | null;
  saveHealthData: (data: HealthData) => void;
  getHealthAnalysis: () => HealthAnalysis;
  healthHistory: HealthDataPoint[];
}
```

## Responsive Design Implementation

The application implements a responsive design using:

- Tailwind CSS responsive breakpoints
- Device-specific layouts using the `useIsMobile` hook
- Conditional rendering based on screen size
- Mobile-first CSS approach

## Routing Structure

Routes are defined in `App.tsx` using React Router:

- Public routes: Home, Login, Signup
- Protected user routes: Dashboard, Health Form, Analysis, Profile, Settings
- Admin-only routes: Admin Dashboard

## Best Practices

### Component Structure

Each component follows this structure:

1. Imports
2. Type definitions
3. Component function
4. Logic and hooks
5. Return JSX
6. Export statement

### Code Style

- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow functional programming principles
- Use React hooks for state and effects
- Implement lazy loading for performance
- Leverage Tailwind CSS for styling

### Performance Considerations

- Component memoization for expensive renders
- Code-splitting for large page components
- Optimized re-renders using `useMemo` and `useCallback`
- Image optimization techniques

## Development Workflow

1. Setup development environment
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`
3. Run development server with `npm run dev`
4. Build for production using `npm run build`
5. Preview production build with `npm run preview`

## Testing

- Component testing with React Testing Library
- Form validation testing
- Authentication flow testing
- Responsive design testing across devices

## Deployment

The application can be deployed through various methods:

- Static hosting on services like Netlify or Vercel
- Docker containerization for environment consistency
- CI/CD pipeline integration

## Security Considerations

- Authentication token management
- Role-based access control
- Form input sanitization
- Protected routes implementation
- Data privacy practices
